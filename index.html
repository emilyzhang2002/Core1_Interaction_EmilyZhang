    <p class="short-bio">This is my portfolio. I like drawing and installation art very much, and I like to express my ideas in those ways. I was born in a happy family with a strong artistic atmosphere. My mother is a fine art teacher. I still remember the first time I learned to use a pencil to draw something when I was only four years old. During my primary school years, I participated in many painting competitions and gained a series of prizes. Many of my classmates began to collect my works because they thought my paintings were beautiful and worth collecting. Even at such a young age, I initiated the idea regarding my future career, to design beautiful visual art works and make our world more colorful. </p>

    <p>Almost everyone has favorite animals. Horses, my own  Chinese Zodiac, the figure of horses accompany with me  which also lead me to my favorite sport-horse-back  riding. Now I also have my own pet horse called Diamond. During 6 years studying, I learned to be persistence, try to  not give up even when I faced difficulty and injury and try  to use a patient heart to treat people. I combine the western unicorn with  Chinese elements. I try to make my  painting into the packages of  cosmetic products since for most of  the girls:  they like to spend time on  discussing the pretty cosmetic  products. So putting the elegant  creature on the cosmetic package  would draw on attention and fit the  girls' favor.  </p>
