    <p class="short-bio">This is my portfolio. I like drawing and installation art very much, and I like to express my ideas in those ways. I was born in a happy family with a strong artistic atmosphere. My mother is a fine art teacher. I still remember the first time I learned to use a pencil to draw something when I was only four years old. During my primary school years, I participated in many painting competitions and gained a series of prizes. Many of my classmates began to collect my works because they thought my paintings were beautiful and worth collecting. Even at such a young age, I initiated the idea regarding my future career, to design beautiful visual art works and make our world more colorful. </p>

    <p>Almost everyone has favorite animals. Horses, my own  Chinese Zodiac, the figure of horses accompany with me  which also lead me to my favorite sport-horse-back  riding. Now I also have my own pet horse called Diamond. During 6 years studying, I learned to be persistence, try to  not give up even when I faced difficulty and injury and try  to use a patient heart to treat people. I combine the western unicorn with  Chinese elements. I try to make my  painting into the packages of  cosmetic products since for most of  the girls:  they like to spend time on  discussing the pretty cosmetic  products. So putting the elegant  creature on the cosmetic package  would draw on attention and fit the  girls' favor.  </p>

<p>
    I realized that what we do everyday hurt our  body every much. My friends always stay up  late in order to chatting with her boyfriend  online. My childhood friend would like to make  himself looks cooler; he would smoke and drink  a little when he is in a party. My bestie orders  a dessert everyday after school, after a  semester, she found herself gain 8 pounds. Besides, the large amount of work, young  people have to sit in front of the computer for a  long time, they have no regularity in diet and  become bald. We sometimes use a humorous way to  say that, Previous young people were  energetic and passionate about life  Young people nowadays have no hair  and love takeout food. I would like to  use young people's favorite current  trend-Black and white & Doodling to  complete my project. </p>

<p>
    According to my own experience, I am an animal  enthusiasts, and I have kept a horse, dogs, bunnies, turtles, parrots, a lizard, a snake and even some insects. But my  mom love to grow plant, and my pet always ruin her plant. Pet in some way are hard to take care of, just like taking  care of a fluffy naughty son. Can people keep a" plant pet"? Which is small and portable that we may carry it in the pot  to Pol. Or parents and children may take care of the  creature separately, for example, my parents are in charge  of the plant part and Imay look after the animal part. Many  people post their cool pet on Instagram and then the pet  becomes an online celebrity.  </p>
